No, no, Nancy. No this was [inaudible] and I moved on her very heavily in fact I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said I'll show you where they have some nice furniture. I moved on her like a bitch. I couldn't get there and she was married. Then all-of-a-sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look.
Look at you. You are a pussy.
Maybe it's a different one.
Yeah that's her with the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful... I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything.
Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.
It looks good.
Oh nice legs huh.
It's always good if you don't fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?
Hello, how are you? Hi.
Nice seeing you. Terrific. Terrific. You know Billy Bush?
We're ready. Let's go. Make me a soap star.
Absolutely. Melania said this was okay.
Good. After you. Come on Billy, don't be shy.
Get over here, Billy.
Good. That's better.
That's better.
I don't know, that's tough competition.
Which way?
Okay. Okay. Oh, you're finished?
Oh. Good.
